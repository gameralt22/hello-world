Hello Visitors!

My name is Adam Feutz and I am pursuing a degree in Software Development.
I have no prior experience in programming prior to this semester.
I am pursuing this career path because my other interests are not as rewarding.
Ideally I hope to work for a passionate company and work on side projects as hobbies.
I feel as though not enough people realize both Tango and Cash were in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.
